# C++/SDL2 Mandelbrot
>#### Currently looking for a better coloring function...
+ CPU bound
+ a couple optimizations: border tracing, multithreading (**OpenMP**) and SIMD (**AVX2**)
  _(if supported by your hardware)_
+ **Zoom in/out with mouse wheel**
+ **Increase/decrease max iterations by pressing UP/DOWN**
+ Build with "make"
+ Feel free to report bugs and make suggestions for improvement :)
+ Inspiration:
